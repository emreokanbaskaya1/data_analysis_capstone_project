# Capstone Project: YouTube and Spotify Data Analysis

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, I analyzed data from YouTube and Spotify, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualized the results using Power BI. This project is documented and available on GitHub. The files to be included in the repository are:

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Track:** The name of the track as displayed on Spotify.
- **Artist:** The name of the artist.
- **Url_spotify:** The URL of the artist on Spotify.
- **Album:** The album in which the track is included on Spotify.
- **Album_type:** Indicates whether the track is a single or part of an album.
- **Uri:** The Spotify URI used to find the track via Spotify API.
- **Danceability:** Describes how suitable a track is for dancing. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
- **Energy:** A measure of intensity and activity, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.
- **Key:** The key of the track. Values range from -1 (no key detected) to 11, representing the pitch class notation.
- **Loudness:** The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB), typically ranging between -60 and 0 dB.
- **Speechiness:** Detects the presence of spoken words in a track. Higher values indicate more speech-like qualities.
- **Acousticness:** A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.
- **Instrumentalness:** Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. Values closer to 1.0 indicate higher likelihood of the track being instrumental.
- **Liveness:** Detects the presence of a live audience. Higher values represent a greater probability of the track being performed live.


## Conclusion

This project aims to demonstrate the ability to perform comprehensive data analysis and visualization, providing valuable insights from the YouTube and Spotify datasets. The analysis covers various aspects such as track characteristics, artist popularity, and listening habits.
